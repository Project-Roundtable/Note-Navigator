# Note Navigator

## What is Note Navigator?
Note Navigator is a game inspired by The Impossible Game and Geometry Dash. This is a 2D platformer where you play a missing note in music track trying to find its way back. Your goal is to navigate the stage to complete the music track and save the lost note. This is being developed as part of [Project Roundtable](https://github.com/Project-Roundtable) by [Luke Skinner](https://github.com/LJSkinner) and [Andrew McGuckin](https://github.com/AndrewMcGuckin) as well as some UI and Artist contributions by Jonas Joost. 

## Why did we make this?
We're always trying to better ourselves, and we have ideas for our dream game that we'd like to create in the future. But, we had to start somewhere simpler. Thus this is where we started with a 2D platformer.
